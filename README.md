# Pacman
Project codes for [CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, UC Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/).

## Search
Here, Pacman has to only locate the food in the grid and eat it. No ghosts involved. 

Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost and A* search algorithms to solve
navigation and travelling salesman problems in Pacman world.

## Multi-Agent
Here, Pacman has to evade ghosts as well as locate food and eat it.

Implemented multi-agent minimax and expectimax algorithms, designed evaluation functions.
